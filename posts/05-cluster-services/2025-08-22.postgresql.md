Almost without fail the author has found it necessary to pause the
deployment of whatever new toy it is that's about to go onto the
freshly-installed and clean (so clean) cluster and first get
a database up and running due to an unmaintained, or unmentioned,
or semi-supported dependency that they would have known about if
only they had spent like 15 more minutes reading the docs than they
did. Alas, this is the life.

So, for the purposes of this demonstration, the very first workload
that we will deploy will be a {term}`PostgreSQL` {term}`RDBMS`. For the moment
there isn't anything on the cluster, or plans to put anything on the
cluster that would require adding replication to this deployment,
but should the cluster develop this requirement this post will
be updated with sort-of complete instructions on how to convert
the related Helm Chart to one that will support replication.

title: Deploy the CSI LVM Storage Classes 
---

While it's possible to statically provision storage, especially if you're 
a contrarian fool like the author (and presumably readers) of this work, 
it is also much less convenient and perhaps a little gauche to do so.

In this post we'll deploy to our cluster the first layer of dynamically
provisioned storage that we will make available via the Container
Storage Interface, or CSI. It will use the CSI LVM driver.

title: Where the is a cluster the must be communication
---

And communication requires signals, some of which will need to be stored in
a surprising and enlightening number of ways. This chapter will see install
to our cluster the selected networking services (flannel, metallb,
ingress-nginx, cert-manager) to allow for ingress using
external DNS and communication between clusters. We will also install both
local storage using the CSI LVM driver and distributed storage using the
Rook Ceph suite.

title: Load balaning with metallb 
---

Before we can effectively allow ingress from the Internet or other networks
into the cluster we'll need to balance incoming requests with a load balancer.
In this tutorial we'll be using metallb because it is simple to deploy, offers
both L2 and L3 deployment options, and was the first one the author got working
and understood at the same time.

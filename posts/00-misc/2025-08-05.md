The author recently discovered the very handy tool
{term}`EasyRSA` which, as the name implies,
aims to make managing RSA easy. It succeeds mostly in this goal,
though with the bar set at "easier than OpenSSL," this isn't saying all that much.

That said, the {term}`EasyRSA` manual isn't quite as complete as
a novice user would hope and leaves out a meaningful description
of the process through which one might set up an Intermediate CA. It's not immediately
obvious, or at least wasn't to the author, so the discovery of
[Build a Root and Intermediate Certificate Authority with EasyRSA](https://www.dinhphu28.com/blog/2025/build-a-root-and-intermediate-certificate-authority-with-easy-rsa/)
by [Dinh Phu Nguyen](https://www.dinhphu28.com/) was a day brightener for the author.

If you happen to find yourself with a desire to use an Intermediate CA and {term}`EasyRSA`
at the same time, save yourself a lot of trouble and read the excellent guide
linked above.

Thank you for your attention in this matter.

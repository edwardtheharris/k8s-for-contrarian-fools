For some reason, when the author checked LinkedIn today to set up an interview for
what could turn out to be a pretty cool job tomorrow, he was confronted with
[this terrible post by some idiot, who is wrong on the Internet](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcotroisi_junior-engineers-should-be-allowed-or-forced-activity-7406655551540977664-dTl3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAABjDaUBM8fKYEg9CHbN-iOpMmZmTzAn67I].
And, being the mature, sensible, and immune to idiots being wrong on the Internet
fellow that no one ever thought of as a cool guy that he is, the author ignored it
and went on about his business.

```{blockquote}
The editorial team would like to note that this is not in the author's nature
and he has been spotted in numerous places correcting people on the Internet
on topics ranging from English grammar to U.S. Foreign policy in any given
era. We suspect he may enjoy this more than his other primary use of the Internet,
pornography.
```

Just kidding! The author was immediately enraged by this clear fool's ignorance
and set about writing a response on LinkedIn that was sure to reduce his
chances of finding work and have absolutely no effect on the inciting idiot
at all. Toward the end of the twelve hundred character limit for these kinds
of things that LinkedIn as put in place, the author realized that LinkedIn
was not, in fact, the place to post his response to the inciting idiot but
that it would do much better on this very blog.

So where we are.

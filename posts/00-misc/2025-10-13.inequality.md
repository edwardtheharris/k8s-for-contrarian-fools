## . . . But inequality is interested in you

The longer people fail to recognize that blue collar and white collar are the
same people with a lot more in common with each other than the people that
have broken the economy, the longer those people that have broken the economy
will get away with it.

You think you have it rough as a white collar worker who's been out of work
for six months (like myself)? Try being actually impoverished in the current
economy then consider who made you that way, because it wasn't you. Blue
collar workers are not stupid, they just don't mind getting dirty. They have
all the same problems you do, just with less opportunity.

The people who own things are the people that you should be angry with.
It's the people in charge, the greedy, power-hungry, idiot class that's put
all of us here, and they deserve all of the rage you can direct at them.

```{topic} Progress so far
At this point in our cluster deployment we should have 1 control plane node
and at least two worker nodes that will not present themselves as ready
due to the lack of a proper CNI plugin.

In this post, we'll install that plugin and make sure it's working.

## First thing, we kill all the lawyers

Wait, this isn't a revolution, this is {term}`Kubernetes` any murders will be
strictly confined to marketing. Seriously, though, there are quite a few
[Networking Add Ons](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/#networking-and-network-policy)
for {term}`Kubernetes` to choose from.

The author has direct experience with
[Calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/),
[Cillium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium), and
[Flannel](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel#deploying-flannel-manually).
For the purposes of this demonstration we'll be using Flannel since it's as
close to a plug and play solution as we've found.

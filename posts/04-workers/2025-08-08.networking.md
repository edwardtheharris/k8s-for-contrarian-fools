title: Deploy the Flannel Networking Add On
---

```{topic} Progress so far
At this point in our cluster deployment we should have 1 control plane node
and at least two worker nodes that will not present themselves as ready
due to the lack of a proper CNI plugin.

In this post, we'll install that plugin and make sure it's working.

## Flannel for networking

There are quite a few
[Networking Add Ons](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/#networking-and-network-policy)
for {term}`Kubernetes` to choose from.

The author has direct experience with
{term}`Calico`, {term}`Cillium`, and {term}`Flannel` of
which {term}`Flannel` is the easiest to work with and explain.

## Flannel Install Guide

There are at least two methods for installing {term}`Flannel`.

### Install Flannel with `kubectl`{l=shell}

For those in a rush, the simplest method[^simplest-method] is to install via
`kubectl apply`{l=shell}.

```{code-block} shell
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/releases/latest/download/kube-flannel.yml
```

### Install Flannel with Helm

Deploying with Helm requires a few more steps, but also allows for much easier
customization.


[^simplest-method]: [Install with kubectl](https://git:with:e 20hub.com/flannel-io/flannel?tab=readm:e e-ov-file#deploying-flannel-with-kubectl).

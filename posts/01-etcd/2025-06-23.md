There are two methods of deploying etcd for the purposes of 
Bare Metal Kubernetes, as a separate cluster or as a workload
in the cluster itself.

We'll be using the Ansible roles in 
[ansible-etcd](https://github.com/edwardtheharris/ansible-etcd)
to deploy etcd to the control plane node as a separate service.

Updates to follow tomorrow.

### Glossary

```{glossary}
ArchLinux
  [ArchLinux](https://archlinux.org) is lightweight and flexible LinuxÂ®
  distribution that tries to Keep It Simple.

etcd
  [etcd](https://etcd.io) is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value
  store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed
  by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader
  elections during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure, even
  in the leader node.

Kubernetes
  Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for automating deployment,
  scaling, and management of containerized applications. Extensive use of
  the [related documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) was made in the
  creation of this guide.

makepkg
  [makepkg](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Makepkg) is a script to automate
  the building of packages. The requirements for using the script
  are a build-capable Unix platform and a PKGBUILD.

yay
